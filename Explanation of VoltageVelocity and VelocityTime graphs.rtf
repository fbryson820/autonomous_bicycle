\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Velocity vs. Effective Voltage graph: We started the given pwm at zero and then incremented the value of the pwm by 5. We then gave a delay of 5 seconds and then plotted the value of the velocity and the effective voltage. This delay was meant to prevent any out of the ordinary transient behavior from affecting our plot. \
\
Velocity vs. Time graph: We wrote a value of 30 to the front motor and then delayed for 5 seconds, then we changed the value of the pwm to 50 and began to plot the value of the velocity every 20 milliseconds over a period of 1.2 seconds. }
